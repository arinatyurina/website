		<h1>/ about</h1>
		<p>Born in Moscow, I made the exciting decision two years ago to move to London. Since then, I’ve been immersing myself in the world of software engineering at 42 London, where I’m currently diving deep into C++ and honing my skills. My programming journey began with C, and now I’m focused on mastering C++ through challenging projects.</p>

		<p>In addition to my studies, I've had the chance to teach programming to children in London, which was both challenging and rewarding. I also participated in crowd acting a few times, an experience that was enjoyable but sometimes repetitive.</p>
		
		<p>I hold a Bachelor’s in Sociology from Lomonosov Moscow State University, and I’m now continuing my studies in tech at 42 London. I’m passionate about learning, coding, and exploring new challenges in the software engineering world.</p>
