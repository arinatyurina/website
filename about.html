I was born in Moscow, Russia. I studied Sociology at Moscow State University.
Right after getting my Bachelor's degree in 2022 I made a decision to leave my hometown and start over in London.
I'm currently studying at 42 London - project based Computer Science school. Here i've been working on C and C++ languages.
But I am very much open to explore new things and I'm happy to take on challenges on different areas.
